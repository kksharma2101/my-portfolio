                    Hi, I`m Komal Sharma, a web developer who specializes in creating
                    dynamic and responsive websites and web applications. I use the latest
                    technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and more to build
                    websites that are not only visually appealing but also high-performing
                    and scalable.
                </p>
                <p className="pt-3 font-serif text-justify">
                    In addition to my technical skills, I also understand the importance
                    of on-page SEO in driving relevant traffic to a website. By optimizing
                    the content and HTML source code of each page, I ensure that the
                    websites I create rank higher on search engines, improving user
                    engagement and overall performance.
                </p>

                    I`m passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences that help
                    businesses and individuals achieve their goals. Let`s work together to
                    bring your ideas to life and make a difference on the web!
